# UFOs
## Overview
- This challenge included using Javascript to build dynamic webpages and other customization tools that include Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.

- The purpose of this challenge was to utilize a JavaScript array and use it to create an organized table. This challenge also included using JavaScript and HTML to allow the user to filter and find specific events within the data. Finally, we use HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to read the Javascript code and create a webpage that is easy to view and use. The website includes elements such as images and an overview of the website, as seen in the snapshot below.

2. Once you feel comfortable with the available filters, it is time for you to dig in and try any filter you'd like. Once you type in one or multiple filters and hit enter, the data table will be automatically updated. (See image Below)

3. Notice how filtering by the shape "circle" updates the table. Now, feel free to explore and play with any filters you wish.
